At the initiative of Moldavian Hospodar Vasile Lupu, in 1645 the church was build in it current shape. Building blocks were hewn sandstone. The single-nave church has a defensive character - its walls are thick and the windows small, also further demonstrated by the loopholes in the upper storeys of the tower. Enclosed is an octagonal apse. The wall bears the coat of arms of Moldavia of the hospodar - the head of an aurochs with the sun, moon and star. In 1885, a fundamental overhaul of the entire building was made. The high, square tower is linked organically with the competent body of the temple. In 1908 he was covered with a new, domed helmet, designed by architect Mykhailo Luzhetskiy and placed at the current helmet tent, then the smaller towers at the corners were added. A decorative element of the tower is an attic with a blind arcade of arches of Romanesque and Renaissance pilasters. In 1987-1990, a new bell tower was built in the courtyard in front of the facade, which was harmonized with architecture of the old church.\'" }));
